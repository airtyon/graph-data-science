= Relationship operations
:description: This section details the operations available over relationships and relationship properties stored in projected graphs within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


The Neo4j Graph Data Science Library provides multiple operations to work with relationships and their properties stored in a projected graphs.
Relationship properties are either added during the graph projection or when using the `mutate` mode of our graph algorithms.

To inspect the relationship topology only, the `gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream` procedure can be used.
To inspect stored relationship property values, the `streamRelationshipProperties` procedure can be used.
This is useful if we ran multiple algorithms in `mutate` mode and want to retrieve some or all of the results.

To persist relationship types in a Neo4j database, we can use `gds.graph.relationship.write`.
Similar to streaming relationship topologies or properties, it is also possible to write back to Neo4j.
This is similar to what an algorithm `write` execution mode does, but allows more fine-grained control over the operations.
By default, no relationship properties will be written. To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

We can also remove relationships from a named graph in the catalog.
This is useful to free up main memory or to remove accidentally added relationship types.

== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

image::example-graphs/node-similarity.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (dave:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (eve:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (guitar:Instrument {name: 'Guitar'}),
  (synth:Instrument {name: 'Synthesizer'}),
  (bongos:Instrument {name: 'Bongos'}),
  (trumpet:Instrument {name: 'Trumpet'}),

  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(guitar),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(synth),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 3, strength: 0.5}]->(bongos),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(guitar),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(synth),
  (carol)-[:LIKES { score: 2 }]->(bongos),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 3 }]->(guitar),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 1 }]->(synth),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(bongos)
----

.Project the graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsAndInstruments',
  ['Person', 'Instrument'],         // <1>
  {

        },
        score: {
          property: 'score'         // <4>
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
----
<1> Project node labels `Person` and `Instrument`.
<2> Project relationship type `LIKES`.
<3> Project property `strength` of relationship type `LIKES` setting a default value of `1.0` because not all relationships have that property.
<4> Project property `score` of relationship type `LIKES`.

.Compute the Node Similarity in our graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.mutate('personsAndInstruments', {   // <1>
  mutateRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR',                        // <2>
  mutateProperty: 'score'                                   // <3>
})
----
<1> Run NodeSimilarity in `mutate` mode on `personsAndInstruments` projected graph.
<2> The algorithm will add relationships of type `SIMILAR` to the projected graph.
<3> The algorithm will add relationship property `score` for each added relationship.


=== Stream


[[catalog-graph-stream-relationship-topology-example]]
==== Topology

The most basic case for streaming relationship information from a named graph is streaming its topology.
In this example below we stream relationship topology for all relationship types, represented by source, target and relationship type.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream all relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream(
  'personsAndInstruments'                  // <1>
)
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, relationshipType
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name as source, gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name as target, relationshipType
ORDER BY source ASC, target ASC
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.

| "Alice" | "Bob"         | "SIMILAR"
| "Alice" | "Bongos"      | "LIKES"
| "Alice" | "Carol"       | "SIMILAR"
| "Alice" | "Dave"        | "SIMILAR"

As we can see from the results, we get two relationship types (`SIMILAR` and `LIKES`).
We can further on filter the relationship types we want to stream.
This can be achieved by passing a second argument to the procedure as demonstrated in the next example.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream a single relationship for specific relationship type:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream(
  'personsAndInstruments',                  // <1>
  ['SIMILAR']                               // <2>
)
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, relationshipType
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name as source, gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name as target, relationshipType
ORDER BY source ASC, target ASC
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> List of relationship types we want to stream from, only use the ones we need.

[[catalog-graph-stream-single-relationship-property-example]]
==== Single property

The most basic case for streaming relationship properties from a named graph is a single property.
In the example below we stream the relationship property `score`.

[role=query-example]
--
.Stream a single relationship property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream(
  'personsAndInstruments',                  // <1>
  'score'                                   // <2>
)
YIELD
  sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, relationshipType, propertyValue
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name as source, gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name as target, relationshipType, propertyValue
ORDER BY source ASC, target ASC
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The property we want to stream out.

As we can see from the results, we get two relationship types (`SIMILAR` and `LIKES`) that have the `score` relationship property.
We can further on filter the relationship types we want to stream, this is demonstrated in the next example.

NOTE: The properties we want to stream must exist for each specified relationship type.

[[catalog-graph-relationship-to-undirected-example]]
=== Convert to undirected

Some algorithms such as Triangle Count and Link Prediction expect undirected relationships. The following shows how to convert the relationships of type `LIKES` in the graph from directed to undirected by creating an undirected relationship of new type `INTERACTS`.

[role=query-example]
--
.Convert relationships from directed to undirected:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.relationships.toUndirected(
  'personsAndInstruments',                                          // <1>
  {relationshipType: 'LIKES', mutateRelationshipType: 'INTERACTS'}  // <2>
)
YIELD
  inputRelationships, relationshipsWritten
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> A map that includes the relationship type to make undirected and the relationship type to be added to the graph.

Here is an illustration of how the example graph looks in Neo4j after executing the example above.

image::example-graphs/convert_relationships_graph.svg[Visualization of the example graph after converting the relationships to undirected,align="center"]

[[catalog-graph-write-relationship-example]]
=== Write

We can write relationships stored in a named in-memory graph back to Neo4j.
This can be used to write algorithm results (for example from xref:algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity]) or relationships that have been aggregated during graph creation.

The relationships to write are specified by a relationship type.

NOTE: Relationships are always written using a single thread.

==== Relationship type

By default, no relationship properties will be written, as it can be seen from the results, the `relationshipProperty` value is `null` and `propertiesWritten` are `0`.

Here is an illustration of how the example graph looks in Neo4j after executing the example above.

image::example-graphs/write_relationships_graph.svg[Visualization of the example graph after writing relationships back,align="center"]

The `SIMILAR` relationships have been added to the underlying database and can be used in Cypher queries or for projecting to in-memory graph for running algorithms.
The relationships in this example are undirected because we used xref:algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity] to mutate the in-memory graph and this algorithm creates undirected relationships, this may not be the case if we use different algorithms.


==== Relationship type with property

To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

[[catalog-graph-delete-rel-type]]
=== Delete

We can delete all relationships of a given type from a named graph in the catalog.
This is useful to free up main memory or to remove accidentally added relationship types.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting relationships of a given type is only possible if it is not the last relationship type present in the graph.
If we still want to delete these relationships we need to xref:graph-drop.adoc[drop the graph] instead.
