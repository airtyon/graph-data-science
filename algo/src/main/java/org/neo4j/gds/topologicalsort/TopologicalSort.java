/*
 * Topological sort algorithm.
 *
 * Topological sort is not defined for graphs with cycles. If the graph contains cycles this implementation will ignore
 * all the nodes that are part of the cycle, and also all the nodes that are reachable from a cycle.
 *
 * For example for this graph:
 *  (A)-->(B)<-->(C)-->(D)
 * Only A will be returned by the topological sort because it is the only node that is not part of a cycle or reachable
 * from a cycle.
